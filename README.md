## About:
I tend to come and go nowadays. I tend to deal with anxiety and will likely stutter a lot.

## Hobbies:
- Pokes around with Minecraft plugins sometimes or fork something when got nothing to do. May commit or not. It depends.
- Somehow makes a spigot plugin or a dedicated server to work with that special magic of üç∫

## Quotes:
- Unity's ragdoll physics. They just work.
- What baked lighting?
- What baked reflection probes?
